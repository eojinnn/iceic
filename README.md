# ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a novel sound source localization method that combines Coherent-to-Diffuse Ratio (CDR) estimation with Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) to improve Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation in reverberant and noisy environments. First, a binary diffuseness mask derived from CDR estimation is applied to suppress the effects of reverberation and noise. Then, the GCC-PHAT algorithm is used to calculate the crosscorrelation between signals from two microphones, followed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure adopted from the PGCC paper to refine the TDOA estimation. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in complex acoustic environments compared to the conventional GCC-PHAT. Experimental results using simulated data show that, in a challenging environment with T60 of 0.6 seconds and a very low SNR of 0 dB, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) decreased from 1.40 cm with the conventional GCC-PHAT method to 0.94 cm with the proposed method.
